## Feat: Add Multi-Language Support

**Description**: Implement multi-language support to cater to a broader audience.

**Tasks**:
1. **Research and select a suitable localization library**:
   - Investigate popular localization libraries such as `react-i18next`, `react-intl`, or `lingui`.
   - Choose the library that best fits the project's architecture and requirements.

2. **Implement language switcher in the UI**:
   - Design a language switcher component that allows users to select their preferred language.
   - Integrate the language switcher into the main navigation or header of the website.
   - Ensure the selected language is stored in the user's preferences (e.g., local storage or user profile settings).

3. **Translate key parts of the website**:
   - Identify and extract translatable strings from the existing codebase.
   - Create translation files for the supported languages (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`, `es.json`).
   - Use the selected localization library to replace hardcoded strings with their corresponding translations.

4. **Add a guide for contributing translations**:
   - Create a documentation file (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md`) that provides guidelines for adding new translations.
   - Include instructions on how to create new translation files and where to place them in the project directory.
   - Provide a template for translation files and explain the process of submitting translation contributions via pull requests.

**Additional Notes**:
- Ensure that the localization implementation does not impact the website's performance.
- Test the language switcher and translations thoroughly to guarantee a seamless user experience.
- Consider starting with a few major languages and gradually expanding based on community contributions and user feedback.
